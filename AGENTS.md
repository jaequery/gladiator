# AGENTS.md — conventions for working in this repo

Gladiator is a browser-native recreation of the Quake mod *Rocket Arena*:
round-based 1v1 duels, full health on spawn, no pickups, a rocket launcher and
a railgun. It runs the same simulation in the browser and on the server. Almost
every convention below exists to protect that one sentence.

Vocabulary is in [`CONTEXT.md`](./CONTEXT.md). Physics numbers are in
[`docs/physics-spec.md`](./docs/physics-spec.md).

## Commands

| Command              | What it does                                          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`       | install (pnpm 10, exact versions, `--frozen-lockfile` in CI) |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` in every package                        |
| `pnpm run lint`      | ESLint over the whole repo                             |
| `pnpm run test`      | Vitest, once                                           |
| `pnpm run build`     | Vite (client) and esbuild (server)                     |
| `pnpm run guardrails`| proves the simulation boundary rejects violations      |
| `pnpm run ci`        | all five, in that order — what CI runs                 |
| `pnpm run e2e`       | the browser smoke test — needs Chromium, own CI job    |

> `pnpm run ci`, not `pnpm ci`. pnpm reserves the bare `ci` verb
> (`ERR_PNPM_CI_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`) and will not fall through to a package
> script of that name.

## Packages

| Package             | May depend on            | Built?                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `packages/sim`      | **nothing**              | never — consumed as source    |
| `packages/bot`      | `sim`                    | never — consumed as source    |
| `packages/client`   | `sim`, `bot`, Babylon    | Vite                          |
| `packages/server`   | `sim`, `bot`, `ws`       | esbuild                       |

`sim` and `bot` are source-only. Their `exports` point straight at `./src/*.ts`
and there is no `dist`, so there is exactly one resolution condition and nothing
for `bundler` and `NodeNext` to disagree about.

---

## The simulation boundary

`packages/sim` must produce **bit-identical** results from the same inputs, in
V8 and in JavaScriptCore, in a browser tab and in a Node process. Two peers that
disagree by one ULP diverge into two different games within seconds.

That property is enforced in three layers. The ordering matters, because only
the first cannot be switched off by someone in a hurry.

### 1. Resolution — unfakeable

`packages/sim/package.json` declares `"dependencies": {}`, literally. And
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `hoistPattern: []` and `publicHoistPattern: []`, so
pnpm creates no shared `node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules` bucket for a package
to accidentally resolve through.

The result is that `import '@babylonjs/core'` inside `packages/sim` fails to
*resolve*. Not fails to lint — fails to exist. **Do not add a dependency to
`packages/sim`.** If you find yourself wanting to, the code you are writing
belongs in `client`, `server` or `bot`, and the sim should be handed the result
as a plain value.

### 2. The typechecker — the editor tells you

`packages/sim/tsconfig.json` sets:

- `"lib": ["ES2023"]` — no `DOM`, so `window`, `document` and `console` are
  `Cannot find name` errors
- `"types": []` — no ambient `@types/*` at all, so `process`, `Buffer` and
  `setTimeout` are too, even when a dependency's `.d.ts` would otherwise drag
  them in
- `"rootDir": "./src"` — reaching sideways into another package by relative
  path is `TS6059`, not a code-review comment

### 3. ESLint — for what resolves fine and types fine

Banned in `packages/sim` only, each with an error message explaining itself:

| Banned                          | Because                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Math.random()`                 | draw from the seeded PRNG in the sim state instead              |
| `Date.now()`, `new Date()`      | the sim has no clock; it knows its tick number                  |
| `performance.now()`             | wall-clock drives the scheduler, never the simulation           |
| `Math.hypot()`                  | implementation-approximated — use `Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)`    |
| `Math.sin`, `Math.cos`, `Math.pow`, … | implementation-approximated — use `sim/src/trig.ts`        |
| `**` and `**=`                  | implementation-approximated (so is `Math.pow`) — multiply out   |
| `async` / `await`               | a tick is a synchronous, total function of `(state, inputs)`    |
| bare / cross-package imports    | see layer 1                                                     |

`scripts/guardrails.mjs` writes deliberately-violating code into
`packages/sim`, runs the check that should reject it, and fails if the check
passes. It runs in `pnpm run ci`. A guardrail nobody has watched fire is a
guardrail nobody knows is connected.

---

## The simulation kernel

`packages/sim/src/kernel.ts`. Numbers and the reasoning behind them are
[`docs/physics-spec.md` §0.1](./docs/physics-spec.md).

### `tick()` mutates `GameState` in place

```ts
tick(state, inputs)          // advances `state` by one 8 ms sub-step
const before = cloneGameState(state)   // if you need the old one, say so
```

It returns nothing, allocates nothing in the steady state, and keeps the same
entity objects — a reference you held before the call points at the new values
after it. This is deliberate: a tick runs 125 times a second per room and
reconciliation replays dozens of them per correction, and a fresh world object
per tick is garbage nobody needs to make.

It is also the one genuinely surprising thing about the API, which is why it is
written down here. **A caller that needs the previous state calls
`cloneGameState` first.** Getting this wrong produces a bug that only appears
under packet loss, which is the worst kind to go looking for.

### Sub-steps, not frames

The host reports elapsed wall-clock; the kernel converts it into whole 8 ms
sub-steps and carries the remainder:

```ts
const kernel = createKernel(createGameState(seed))
advanceHost(kernel, clampHostDelta(dtMs), commands, onTick)
```

`advanceHost` runs exactly `floor((remainder + dtMs) / 8)` sub-steps — no
hidden clamp, because throwing time away after a hitch is scheduler *policy*
and belongs to whoever can also tell the other peer about it. Run the measured
delta through `clampHostDelta` first.

`onTick` fires after **every sub-step**, not once per host frame. Sampling
state per frame silently skips whichever ticks shared one.

### Phase order

`tick()` runs fixed phases, and the order is the contract later tickets build
against: advance the PRNG, apply commands, integrate, expire. Adding a phase
means deciding where it goes, once, for everyone.

The PRNG (`rng.ts`, mulberry32 over one uint32) advances once per sub-step
whether or not anything drew from it, so the stream position is a function of
the tick number. It lives in `GameState`, so snapshots, hashing and rewinding
carry it for free.

### One name per number

The timestep is `tick.ts`; the movement constants are `pmove.ts`; angles are
angle units, defined in `usercmd.ts`; sine and cosine are `trig.ts`. The kernel
imports all four rather than restating any of them. Two names for one number is
the drift everything else in this file exists to prevent, so if you find
yourself adding a `constants.ts`, put the constant next to the code that owns
it instead.

`packages/sim` currently holds two worlds: `GameState`/`tick()` (the kernel)
and `PlayerState`/`pmove()` (the walking skeleton's one-player stub, which the
deployed client and server still run). They share the timestep, the plane and
the movement constants deliberately, so they do not disagree about physics.
GLAD-0B1GDS folds the second into the first.

### The golden replay

`packages/sim/src/determinism.test.ts` runs a committed input stream and
compares a committed hash trace sampled every half second. A failure names the
half-second where the two first diverged, and prints the new trace as a
paste-ready literal.

A ticket that changes what a sub-step does **is expected to move that trace**.
Re-bake it by pasting what the failure prints over `GOLDEN_TRACE` in
`src/fixtures/golden-replay.ts`, and say in the commit message why the world
moved. There is no bake script, because a bake script would need a filesystem
and this package does not have one.

`hashState` hashes raw IEEE 754 bit patterns — it never rounds, because
rounding is precisely what would hide a slow drift. It does normalise `-0` to
`+0` and every NaN to one NaN; see `encoding.ts` for why both are necessary.

---

## TypeScript conventions

**Relative imports carry the `.ts` extension.** In `packages/sim` and
`packages/server` this is a lint error, not a preference:

```ts
import { tick } from './step.ts' // yes
import { tick } from './step'    // no — resolves in Vite, fails in Node
import { tick } from './step.js' // no — type-checks, then resolves to nothing
```

`./step.ts` is the only spelling simultaneously valid for Vite, esbuild, `tsx`
and Node's native type stripping.

**`erasableSyntaxOnly` is on repo-wide.** No `enum`, no `namespace`, no
parameter properties — nothing TypeScript would have to *generate code* for.
What survives is types-as-annotations, which Node can strip natively and which
no bundler can get subtly wrong. Use a `const` object with an `as const` and a
union type where you reach for an enum.

**`tsc` never emits.** It is a typechecker; Vite and esbuild emit.

**Versions are pinned exactly.** No caret ranges — a patch bump to Babylon or
TypeScript is a commit someone reviewed, not a surprise on a Tuesday.
TypeScript is held at `6.0.3` on purpose: `typescript-eslint@8` declares a peer
of `>=4.8.4 <6.1.0`, so TypeScript 7 silently breaks linting.

## Coordinate systems

Normative copy: [`docs/physics-spec.md` §0.3](./docs/physics-spec.md). Restated
here because it is the single most expensive thing to get wrong, and because
prose is not a specification.

The simulation thinks in the **Quake frame**: `+x` forward, `+y` left, `+z` up,
right-handed. The renderer draws in the **engine frame**: `+x` right, `+y` up,
`-z` forward, right-handed.

```
(qx, qy, qz) -> (-qy, qz, -qx)
```

As a literal matrix, applied as `e = M · q`:

```
        |  0  -1   0 |
M   =   |  0   0   1 |
        | -1   0   0 |

det(M) = +1
```

`det(M) = +1` means `M` is a pure rotation and the world is not mirrored. The
naive reading — following the axis names and writing one minus sign instead of
two — gives `det = -1`, a rotation composed with a mirror. That version runs,
looks almost right, and makes every rocket-jump curve the wrong way, and no
amount of tuning the movement constants will recover it.

The executable copy is `packages/sim/src/axis.ts`; `axis.test.ts` asserts the
determinant and the basis vectors. `packages/sim` never applies `M` itself —
the conversion happens once, at the renderer boundary.

## Conventions that are just taste

- No semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas. Match the file you are in.
- Comments explain *why*. The code already says what.
- Ticket IDs (`GLAD-XXXXXX`) in comments where a stub is waiting on one.
